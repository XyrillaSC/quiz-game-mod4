# Skylar Kramer's Quiz Game! (Module 4 Challenge)

## Description

This quiz game works by dynamically changing HTML elements using Javascript. The purpose is to provide a fun practice game that can save your score to local storage.

Though the acceptance criteria asked that time be taken from your score for each correct answer, I find myself unable to implement such a feature in a timely manner, as such, this game does no such thing. I do posses the knowledge of how to do such a thing, however it would require a heavy refactor of the code and would set me behind in the class. And as an investment into my future learning over complete correctness, it will remain unimplemented unless I find myself with an abundance of time in the near future, which is unlikely with all the plates I'm currently spinning.
